            <div class = "bio">My name is Jonathon Sisson. I am a senior at Georgia Tech, 
                pursuing a Bachelors of Computer Science. I am a full-stack 
                developer.

                    Star Trader is a game that I worked on with 
                    a team of developers to create. The basic idea
                    of Star Trader is that you are a merchant traveling
                    around a randomly generated galaxy, making trades, and
                    earning money. <a class = projectlink href = startrader.html>Learn more.</a>

                    <div class="projecttitle">Game Boy Snake</div>
                    Game Boy Snake is a remake of the classic game snake.
                    This project was designed using C, and could be 
                    run on real GameBoy hardware.

                    While working for StudyFind I collaborated with a team to
                    create a webcrawler that collects information on clinical trials,
                    generates keywords and brief descriptions based on this information, and 
                    stores the information in a realtime cloud database. <a class = projectlink href = "studyfind.html">Learn more.</a>
