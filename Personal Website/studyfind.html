                This project was a web scraper that collected and stored information on currently running clinical trials.
                This information was gathered from clinicaltrials.gov, a government website on which all clinical trials must
                register. Our system can be run periodically to check for new studies and add them to the cloud-based database that 
                the scraper is linked to. Additionally, the scraper generates two new fields of information using Natural Language 
                Processing. These fields are keywords and a one sentence summary, both generated from the study's description.

                After completing my work on the aforementioned webscraper, I have continued to work for StudyFind, as an intern.
                This internship is currently ongoing, but I have already learned many useful skills. In fact, this website is
                my first personal project in the front-end development program which I am completing. I hope to quickly gain 
                front-end expertise and contribute to StudyFinds current project goals.
