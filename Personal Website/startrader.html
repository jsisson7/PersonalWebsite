                Planets are randomly generated in a grid. Each planet gets
                a technology level ranging from pre-historic to futuristic. This 
                technology level affects what goods the planet will have available to buy,
                and what goods the planet will be interested in purchasing.

                <div class="highlighttitle">Encounters</div>
                While traveling the player has a chance to trigger several
                different encounters. These encounters include space polics, 
                space pirates, and other space traders. Each of these encounters 
                provides the player with different options that have different 
                probabilities of success. For example, when encountering a pirate, the 
                player can choose to run away and not lose any cargo, but they may fail 
                and lose even more cargo.

                <div class="highlighttitle">Goals</div>
                Once the player has done a lot of trading and become very 
                wealthy, there are a few endgame goals for the player to accomplish.
                The player can purchase planets individually, and eventually
                the player can own the entire galaxy.
